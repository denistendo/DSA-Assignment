## Project Overview

It contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms that we've explored during our DSA course. The primary goal is to represent and solve a small instance of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a classical algorithm (e.g. Dynamic Programming, Branch-and-Bound, or Nearest Neighbor) and implementation of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) approach to approximate a solution to the same
TSP instance.

## Features

- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (e.g., Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
  - Graphs

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
  - Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search)
  - Dynamic Programming Solutions

## Installation

To run or test the implementations locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

	git clone https://github.com/denistendo/DSA-Assignment.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

	cd DSA-Assignment

3. Ensure you have Python installed.

Usage

python script_"name".py

Each program may have its own set of input requirements and usage instructions. Refer to the comments within the code or accompanying documentation for specific details.
